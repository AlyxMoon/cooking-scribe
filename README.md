# Family Recipe Box

Basic plan is this:

MVP
- I can create an account and join a group
- I can invite other people to my group (probably via email accounts or something)
- I can create recipes in my group
- I can see recipes other people have made in my group
- I can comment and rate recipes

Further Exploration
- I want to be able to make "variations" of recipes, where I can essentially fork the recipe and make changes. Those variations will have their own ratings and comments
- I want to be able to see a calendar where I can set when I will be making recipes, or when other people in my group make recipes
- I want to be able to export this calendar to Google Calendar.
- I want to be able to make a grocery list from the recipes I will be making, in a selected period of time
